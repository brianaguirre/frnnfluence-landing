===================

Landing page for frnnfluence, a fitness app.

# Running This

We're using the [Yeoman Webapp Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp). Make sure you have Grunt and Yeoman installed (```npm install -g grunt-cli```, ```npm install -g yo```). Once those are installed, run ```grunt serve``` and it'll open it for you.

All the files we want to edit are in ```app/```. (With the exception of the Gruntfile for deployment --- I barely understand that shit myself but we'll figure it out).
